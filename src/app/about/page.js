The Fairfax Community Theatre Company (FCTC) began in 1991 when a small group of Fairfax residents decided to start a community theatre that would allow local people the opportunity to participate in the performing arts without traveling a great distance. A production team was established, a show selected, a director found, actors auditioned; and in late August of that year the musical South Pacific was presented.

The musical Oklahoma was produced the following summer. Since then, FCTC has presented two to four shows per year. To date, we have had forty-two different productions including musicals, dramas, comedies, one-act plays and performance showcases. A number of theater workshops have been offered over the years as well. Along the way, FCTC was formally organized with the creation of by-laws and the formation of a board of directors and a process for choosing annual productions was established.

FCTC show proposals are presented in January. Prospective shows are reviewed by the board of directors for financial feasibility and then voted upon by the FCTC membership. Anyone interested in more information about proposing a show should contact the current FCTC President or another board member.

Participation in FCTC is open to any individual in any community who is interested in the performance, technical or production aspects of community theatre. Membership in the organization is open to any individual over the age of 12 who has participated in a FCTC production within the last year. Membership is free.

Audition and production notices are included in area publications and are also noted on this website. To join the FCTC mailing list and be notified of auditions, productions and all other upcoming events, email us at:
